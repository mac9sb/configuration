#  Log Rotation — newsyslog configuration for com.mac9sb services
#
#  Installed to /etc/newsyslog.d/com.mac9sb.conf during setup.
#  newsyslog runs daily via launchd and rotates matching log files.
#
#  Fields:
#    logfilename          [owner:group] mode count size(KB) when flags
#
#  Flags:
#    G = pattern glob (match wildcard filenames)
#    J = compress rotated logs with bzip2
#    N = no signal needed (no PID file)
#
#  Policy: keep 5 rotated copies, rotate at 1MB or weekly (*), whichever
#  comes first. Compressed with bzip2 to save disk.
